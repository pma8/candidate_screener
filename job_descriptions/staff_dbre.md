# Staff Database Reliability Engineer

## Company
Air

## Role Overview
As a Staff Database Reliability Engineer, you will own the performance, reliability, and scaling strategy for our PostgreSQL Aurora infrastructure that powers creative workflows for leading brands. As a technical leader, you'll partner closely with backend engineering and leadership to architect scalable solutions, establish best-in-class database operations practices, and build the observability framework that keeps Air running at 99.99%+ uptime.

## Core Responsibilities

### Ensure Database Reliability & Performance
Own the health, performance, and availability of Air's PostgreSQL Aurora infrastructure.
* Proactively optimize database parameters, indexes, and query patterns to maintain sub-100ms p95 response times
* Uplevel migration practices and tooling to ensure zero-downtime schema changes as the platform scales
* Establish and maintain comprehensive backup, recovery, and disaster recovery procedures with documented RTO/RPO targets
* Partner with backend engineers to implement database best practices in application code (connection pooling, query optimization, caching strategies)

### Plan and Execute Long-Term Scaling Strategy
Develop multi-quarter roadmap to scale Air's database infrastructure to support 10x growth in asset volume and user activity.
* Collaborate with backend engineers and product leadership to model data growth patterns and anticipate scaling inflection points
* Evaluate and implement horizontal scaling strategies (read replicas, sharding, partitioning) aligned with business needs
* Continuously assess AWS Aurora capabilities, PostgreSQL ecosystem innovations, and emerging database technologies for strategic advantage
* Design and implement database architecture that supports Air's AI-powered features and real-time creative workflows

### Build Observability and Data Health Framework
Create comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and reporting systems to maintain database reliability and inform data-driven infrastructure decisions.
* Implement detailed instrumentation for database performance metrics (query latency, connection pool utilization, replication lag, disk I/O)
* Build automated alerting for anomalies in query performance, connection patterns, and resource utilization
* Create executive-level dashboards showing database health trends, capacity utilization, and cost efficiency
* Develop regular database health review cadence with engineering leadership to surface insights and drive continuous improvement

## Requirements
* Experience: 6+ years using PostgreSQL and working with Distributed Database.
* Technical Ability: Proficient in Postgres Database operations, tuning and query optimization. Familiar with database observability tooling and establishing best practices around health metric. Familiar with AWS Aurora or RDS.
* Entrepreneurial Drive: You like to work in public, own problems end-to-end, and move with intentional speed - so your best ideas ship fast and make a visible dent.
* Obsessed with Winning: Everyone at Air plays to win, says the hard thing, and progresses every day while building genuine relationships.
